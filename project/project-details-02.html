      The housemaid management system for a company involves comprehensive management of client and housemaid interactions. It includes functionalities for adding new clients and housemaids into the system, managing profiles with detailed notes for user preferences and special instructions. The system also provides a clear display of all clients and available housemaids, facilitating efficient matching based on client needs and maid availability.
      In addition to basic management features, the system handles documentation for visa and permanent residency (PR) processes for housemaids, ensuring compliance with legal requirements. It tracks visa application statuses, renewal dates, and expiration notifications to maintain regulatory adherence. This comprehensive approach ensures smooth operations, enhances client satisfaction, and supports the professional development and legal compliance of housemaids within the service framework. </p>
