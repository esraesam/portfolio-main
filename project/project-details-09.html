This system includes procedures for conducting regular inspections to detect mechanical, electrical, or cosmetic problems. It tracks inspection schedules, records findings, and manages repair processes to ensure timely resolution of issues and minimize downtime. The system may utilize digital tools for creating and updating inspection reports, scheduling service appointments, and tracking the status of repairs. By implementing efficient management practices, car check system management aims to enhance vehicle reliability, optimize maintenance costs, and uphold safety and operational standards for the entire fleet. </p>
